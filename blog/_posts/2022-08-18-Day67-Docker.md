# What is Docker and how to use it?
_Docker_ is an open-source platform for creating, deploying and running applications. It allows us to **containarize** 
  an application with all its dependencies and run it easily on any machine even when it is different from the one we 
  tested our application in. 

In other words, it allows us to deploy applications that are isolated from the 
  underlying hardware. Another key advantage to packaging our applications is the ability to run multiple containers 
simultaneously, 
each based in the 
  same or different images. 

Considering an application with microservices, if we package every microservice as a 
docker image  then these services can be deployed as containers on demand.

## Some Docker concepts
Came across at least two: an image and a container. So what's the difference:
- **An image** is "a file that represents a packaged application with all its dependencies needed" [nice article](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/docker-images-vs-containers)
- This file contains a set of instruction needed to run the application.
  - we can think about an image as a class or as a snapshot in a virtual machine environments.
  - This image is built as **a series of layers** which are assembled one on top of the other. This layer hierarchy 
    is key to achieving efficiency in building containers (a change to a layer at the top of a stack involves the 
    least amount of computational work to rebuild the entire image)
  - Docker images are **immutable**, once created they cannot be changed. To change something, we can create another 
    container from the current image, make the needed changes then save those as another image.
  - Unlike VMware (virtual machine), Docker does not create ana entire virtual oeprating system, only the required 
    components to run the application. VNware emulates machine hardware.
- **A container** can be thought of as an instance of a class that is launched from an image. So basically, when we 
  run a Docker image, we are creating one or multiple container instances.
- When a container is launched from an image, a  thin writable layer (called **container layer**) is added to the 
  stack. This layer stores all changes to the container throughout its runtime. More details can be found [here](https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-and-building-docker-images/)

## How to create a Docker image?
From my [readings](https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-and-building-docker-images/), it seems there are two ways to create a Docker image:
- Interactive: by running a container from an existing Docker image, manually changing that container environment 
  through a series of live steps and saving the resulting state as a new image.
- Using a *Dockerfile*: by constructing a plain-text file providing the specifications/instructions to create the 
  Docker image.
