## Morning Session 1: Lessons from AI

- LLMs(Large Language Models) give the impression of knowing.
- Language before motion? 
    - Brain developped and evolved for finer/refine  movement/motion control
    - However, with those LLMs they came with no motion at all.
- Do we really change wieghts of multiple synapses (ex during this discussion) or only a few?


## Morning Session 2
**Emre Neftci**
- They don't actually need spikes to do the task? we need to think about practical tasks?
    - What are the time steps needed to represent the information content in the signal? and we don't need that fine time steps or resolution to solve a task? 
    - Having a coarse time scales still works very well even on tasks that has information content in the order of ms?????


**Christian Pehle**
I couldnt follow :D

**Eleni** Lessons form ChatGPT
- Attention mechanism:
    - Query, key and x: input
        - 
    - $s = Q.K^T$   looking at teh coexistence of tokens in a sentence then apply a softmax on top of that
    - They stack layers of this to go beyong two pairs.

- They ask to predict mask words in the sentence

- Lessons:
    1. Simplicity/ complexity
    2. Scalability: ChatGPT3: 175B parameters
