# Surrogate Gradient
Reading about surrogate gradient paper [by Emre and Zenke, (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09948).
  - The idea of how to deal with discontinuities, how to compute the gradients of nonlinearity, is not new. It is a 
    problem also faced in binary networks
  - There are many ways to overcome this: 
    - Change the model definition by using smoothed models 
    - Surrogate gradients
