**Disclaimer**
This is not the very first work trying to decipher the mechanisms of neural encoding/decoding. Previous work have investigated how spiking neurons models (e.g. **integrate-and-fire (IF)** neuron, **leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)**, **spike response model (SRM)**) encode/decode signals into spikes.
This work can thus be seen as complementary to these studies relating neuron models to a special form of **sigma-delta modulation (SDM)** which is the primary paper's contribution.


## Motivation
Tha main motivation of this line of research is to understand how various neuron models encode continuous-time signals into spikes.

### Why does it matter?

An understanding for biological neural encoding/decoding can:

1. Help us understand how to design efficient low-power encoder and artificial neural networks.
2. Guide how we design decoders that can reconstruct the encoded signals from spikes.
3. Pave the way to designing algorithms that can make sense of the generated spikes for further processing.


## Paper's Main  Contribution
To show that 2 types of spiking neuron models, LIF and the simplified SRM, encode spikes using a form of asynchronous sigma-delta modulation, referred to as Asynchronous-Pulse-Sigma-Delta Modulation (APSDM).

## Methods
The paper is structured into 4 parts. For the sake of this summary, I will focus on the first part since later papers build on the introduced APSDM framework.
1. **Part one** uncovers how LIF and SRM neuron equations can be re-written to match their defined APSDM framework.
2. **Part two** provides a detailed description of the APSDM encoder (a circuit's perspective).
3. **Part three** uncovers the design of a linear, closed-form decoding filter to reconstruct the continuous-signal from spikes.
4. **Part four** compares APSDM to a SDM with supporting examples.


### SDM vs. APSDM
- SDM is clock-based, uniform time sampling and the signal is encoded into a sequence of bits (binary)
- Asynchronous Pulse SDM has no clock; it is event-based sampling. The signal is encoded into time-encoded impulse functions.
