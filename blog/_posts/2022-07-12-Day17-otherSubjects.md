### Today's Progress
- Spent another 2 hours trying to fix the mess of the file namings to be able to plot the data from a second subject.
- Attended group meeting - Simone presented muscle and motor neuron synergies.
- Looked at the data from 3 participants


### Some questions
- How is the MCP reliable angle for index finger flexion/extension while its more about abduction/adduction?
- Can I have access to the online decomposition by Deren?
