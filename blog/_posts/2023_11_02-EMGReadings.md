## Active/Passive Reference Electrodes
Active electrodes facilitate skin preparation. They include the pre-amplifier near the electrode such that amplification happens before any added noise comes in. 
Passive electrodes are traditional ones, they transmit the voltage fluctuations through a conductive wire to an amplifier. They therefore necessitate a well prepared skin (to achieve low-impedence), with a well-glued cap and an amplifier that is few feet away from the subject. The EEG signal is already a weak one and its transmission over a wire can further contaminate it with noise. To overcome this challenge and facilitate placement and preparation, they moved the amplifier closer to the electrode.
