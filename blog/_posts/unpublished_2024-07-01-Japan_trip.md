This trip has been a lifetime experience for me. It was my first time in an Asian country and I was terrified; mainly because it is so different than Europe, and I am always scared of "new"...I can't find the right words to describe this experience: I felt like walking in a dream.

From the very first stop; which was Zurich airport, I started feeling that it is going to be a good trip... like you experience small encounters and you have this inner feeling that things are getting aligned. I went to a kiosk by the departure gate to get a power adapter because Japan uses a type A plug...I went in bought few snacks as well just in case the food on the plane was not good. 

The lovely cashier asked for my boarding pass and imemfiately she was like oh wow you are going to Japan!! and I was like yup and I am terrified of this long flight and trip in general. (Side story, I was very scared actually of getting a blood clot in the plane :D and spent that morning googling tips for surviving flights longer than 10 hours).
She said: ah no embrace it. Don't worry, you will be fine and enjoy it to the max. The things that we are scared of the most usually turns out to be the best experiences, you know. (and indeed she was right). Japan had been my dream destination so you are living my dream. Enjoyy it, it will be great. I was like do you wanna swap, I can give you my boarding pass :D. She said I would love to but my package comes with 2 children :D so not a very good deal for you :D. Have fun!!

My flight was great actually. I flew to Helsinki, only a short 1 hour transit where I was running to pass the passport control and get to the gate. Headed directly to the bathroom to brush my teeth and do my skin care as it was 12 midnight. For this long flight, I had a very comfrtable seat with two empty seats next to me that I could lay down, with my little blanket and pillow and managed to sleep for hours!! 
Ahhh and I spoiled myself with an internet package :D (I has the initial idea that I would work but then nope). So every few hours, I wake up wahstaspp my family then go back to sleep or eat. There was two meals scheduled on this flight and both were delicious, One right after take off and another before landing. I was getting very excited actually, and was very happy with how this trip was going hehe

We arrived in Nagoya at 7 pm. It was a smooth process to get through passport control. Standin in line I started to realize how different I look from other people (haha). I couldnt help admiring a lovely asian women and her daughter. they were very nicely dressed, very elegeant and the most clearer and glowy skin I have seen in my life. 


I went in take my luggage, and a deep breath: we are on!! :D
First stop was to get an eSim, so I went to the first esim shop I found abut there was a women talking to the staff there and it seemed like they would take long so I went to check the trains/trams situation to see how to get to my hotel which was right in front of Kanayama station. Through a small bridge or connection to the other hall where all trains to city depart, here I was, a bit overwhelming to see all the signs in a language I can even procounce, I stayed in the mainhall just looking around to see if there is any symbol I recodnigze (like a little train or tracks or sth). Spotted the information desk and ran there :D. She greeted me with a bow and I was like I am loving the people aready, they are veryyyy veryy kind and polite. I asked her about how to get a train ticket and she pointed to the machines on the left side next to the train gates. At this point I started getting a bit the gest of it, I need something that is called IC card, which guess what turns out to mean integrated circuit :D I went back to the eSIM shop, the lady was already gone, so I headed directly yo the staff and told him I need an esim but no clue what would be a good package for me. We started chatting a bit about how long I would be staying and whether I need to use social media, make video calls or whether maps and whatsapp are enough. I went with the later; he suggested this package from Docomo, it was unlimited for 10 days with a data limit of 3 Gbytes per day. He asked for my passpirt and was surprised to know that I am Egyptian. I took the opportunity to ask him about this IC card and how to get a card that works for public transportation, he said let me show you, you can just add it to your wallet on iPhone (which was superr helpful) and add money in it. He helped me add Passmo card on the phone and then I went back to the other hall where the train departs.

I passed smoothly through the gate by just scanning my IC card and waited for the train. PArt of the platform was in open Air and the moment I crossed Shoot it was humid like a new level of humid and I had my hair down...Waited for the train then went in. I saw people rushing it and they were flipping the seats, it was strange and slightly chaotic that evveryine was doing that so quickly. I didnt' get at first what they are doing but later realized that the seats can be flipped to face wither directions depending on the direction of travel. I sat on one of those fixed sideway benches. A moment later and a guy comes in and he is looking at me and said hi. I said hi back but couldnt tell from where I inow this guy, I thought maybe he is a PhD student going to the conference too haha.
- you dont'remember me, I am the Sim guy
- hahah I said I am sorry. hey there.
He stood in fromt of me as all the seats got taken any ways and we chatted all the way to the hotel. He asked if its my first time in Japan, I told him yes and in all Asia in general. He told me about this Egyptian friend he had and that he wasn't a good person. I said I am sorry you went through this but we are not all the same as your friend :D 
He asked if I could tell that he is Chinese, and I am like whattt really? :D he said yes you couldnt tell. Then about my flight from Helsinki, I said it was quite an empty flight, not many Europeans as well. He said so many Asian-face like peple and laughed. I said I am sorry I am very ignorant in that regard and cant really tell from which part of Asia peoeple are.

It turns out he is an Ecomony major student who took some time off from studying to work a bit. He said do you know where you are going or do you need help since you cant activate your sim before tomorrow.
- Oh thanki you, I willl be fine dont worry, I took a screenshot of the map and stops :D

Still by Kanayama station he insisted on helping me with the luggage. "I know how it is travellig with 2 suitcases, I do the same when I go back to China" I was like "really thank you but you don't have to" 
- Nah its fine, I am close to my place as well so no problem. 
He ended up going with me all the way to the hotel. He asked for my number so he can check on me from time to time and in case I need any tips or recommendations, alaos asked if I had dinner already but I told him its getting very late (it was 10 pm) and I better off go to sleep, it was a long day. 

I went to my room and was so happy with the toilet :D took a shower and tried to plan what to do for Monday and Tuesday. There was this idea of going to Kyoto for a day but I had no clue where Kypto was nor how to get there nor what to see there. So I only texted a friedn who was in Japan recently, told him that I am there (maybe he can help planning :D) and checked the trains:turned out there are those bullet trains that connect popular cities in Japan very fast. They are called Shinkansen trains. From Nagoya to Kyoto there were many of those trains scheduled every 15- 30 mins and it was only 34 mins to Kyoto. Knwoing that I could go to Kyoto easily, I said lets plan the rest of the day tomorrow morning as I was exhausted by then. Also time difference to Cairo was strange to me (6 hours difference).



Monday
-----
- Woke up at 4 am and my brain was active but tried to put myself back to sleep as its the jet lagg effect but couldnt sleep for long.

- By 6 am I was fully awake, had a quick call with the friend who has been in Japan and he convinced me to not do a day trip tp Kyoto but to stay the night there and come back on Tuesday. I was slightly worried about hotels, but it seemed liek there are many so it woulndt be a big problem and worst case scenario is I would get back to Nagoya and sleep the night there. After breakfast, booked the next train I could find, and it was at ..., so I had some time to spare. Packed very lightly just a backpack with one outfit and a pijama, tooth brush and skin care and I was sooo proud of myself...felt like those solo travellers :D
Headed to Nagoya main station and strolled around till I found an underground tunnel with stores, it was exciting....This store is a favorite, I love eerything adn want to buy almost everything but settled on a fan (which is something I reallt wanted to get) and a pocket money.

Found my gate and asked teh security guy how to pass whithout a physical ticket and he let me go through. The train was big,very clean  organized, large leg room for everyone, airconditioned, I had a reserved window seat. The conductor passes everynnow and then. noticed that before he leaves the car he has to turn back ot the passenger and greet then with a bow before leaving (liek how polite!!)
Actually while waiting for the trina in the waiting area, I booked a hotel, just like that. I felt so happy and excited for being that spontaneous, I didn't know I could be that person :D
