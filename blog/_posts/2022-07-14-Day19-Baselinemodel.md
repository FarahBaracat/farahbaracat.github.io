### To do
- Baseline model: regression-based MU for single finger prediction and simultaneously with the wrist
- Split into repetitions by task
- The plot with scaling of the angle joint is not right because it doesn't respect the relative differences between 
  the angles --> the problem is that it scales "each feature individually"
  - Recap: normalization: rescaling the features to fall into a certain range (e.g min-max scaling)
    - Standardization: unit variance
