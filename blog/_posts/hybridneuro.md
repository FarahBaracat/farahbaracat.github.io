- We can get a synchrnonous conditions:
    - evoked contraction: thorugh stimulation of the cortex or a perioheral nervexs
    - Very fast contraction (rapid voluntary contractions and maximal efforts)

- Decomposition:
    - starting with large number of microphones (high dsensity of channels), we can identify voices
    - In evoled contractions: evey one is shouting at the same time.
        - how to identigy units?
            - with monopolar we can distinguish anything! (skarabot, J physiology 2023)
        - They use the filteres identifies from the asynchronous case and apply them on the high synchronization condition (evoked response)
- Trying to build a library of MU filters
- We cant use latency to estimate the recruitement threshold in case of synchronous firing since the condicton velocity play a rorls
    - unit with lowers threshold, would be present across higher contraction. we can then estimate the porbability of firing of that unit. This low thres. unit will have a high probability of firing in evolked potentail
    - Deocmposition algoriths are biased towards identigying bigger units (higher threshold) but Difficult to segment those units apart because of superimposition
    -Difficultiy identigying small MUs
    - The porblem of repplying the filteres 
    - is that some new units will be recuritmed during evoked potential (called phasic units)

- Pribelm MU identdification during rapid (isometric contractions)
    -Challenge 1. change in MUAP waveform
    - 2. ias towards larget potentials
    3. superimoosition
