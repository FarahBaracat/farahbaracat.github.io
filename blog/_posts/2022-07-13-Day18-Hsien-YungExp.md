### Today's Progress
- Participated in Hsien-Yung experiment: very interesting (more on that later)

### Some questions
- Why does getting the ISI between any two spikes and the inverse of that is a reliable way of getting the 
  instantaneous firing rate?
- Can I access the decomposition algorithm in Matlab?
- What is spike-trigering average and why do the MUAP doesn't look like a normal/classic shape of an AP?

### Meeting with Deren
- the reason why some MUs are firing all the time could be because of noise or the subject is actually doing some 
  wrist movement along with the finger movements
- these are dynamic tasks that are decomposed? <mark>Need to recap the difference to isometric decomposition</mark>
- The thumb is not very important if I will use the extrinsic muscles. That is Simone placed the grid on the upper 
  part of the arm which is further away from the main muscles involved in the thumb abduction/adduction and thumb 
  flexion/extension
