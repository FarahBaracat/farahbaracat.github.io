#### My Research Interest
My research interest lies at the intersection between neuroscience and man/machine interfaces. In my PhD, I am developping [neuroprosthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprosthetics) devices that work with the same principles as the peripheral nervous system. 

More precisely, I am researching ways to achieve a more natural, intuitive and efficient control of [EMG-prosthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography) using spike-based processing.

#### A little bit more about me
📍 I am Egyptian, from Cairo 🇪🇬, currently living in Zurich 🇨🇭.

👩🏻‍🎓 I earnt a French Baccalaureate from L'Ecole du Sacré-Coeur in 2011. I then pursued a bachelor degree in Electronics from the American University in Cairo. In 2018, I moved to Zurich for my master's degree in Neural Systems and Computation, ETH/University of Zurich (UZH). Recently, I started my PhD at ETH/UZH.


🎾 I am passionate about Tennis. I learnt to play at the age of 6 and competed in national and international competition until I was 24 years old. Although I don't compete anymore, I still play once or twice a week for the love of the game 😇 (if you want to play just hit me up).

🎼 I play the piano 🎹. Started my piano lessons at the age of 6 as well. I earned Trinity Guidhall diplomas grade 2-8. Now, I enjoy composing piano pieces in my spare time (it helps me relax 🙃)

✍🏻 I like writing articles (usually on random or personal topics) and publishing them from time to time on [Medium](https://farah-baracat.medium.com/). During college, I decided to pursue a minor degree in Rhetoric and Composition (because why not 😀) and it made me realize how much I enjoy writing.
