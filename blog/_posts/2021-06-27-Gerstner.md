## Why am I reading this paper?
While researching supervised learning rules for SNN, one cannot escape the 3-factor learning rule ðŸ˜€. This quite recent review paper nicely summarizes the influence of neuromodulation on STDP between STDP and provides experimental evidence on  neuromodulation in the context of synaptic plasticity.
