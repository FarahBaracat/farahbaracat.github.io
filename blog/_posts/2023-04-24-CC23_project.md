In this post, I describe what I would like to work on during CC workshop.

**Topic: Learning the individual neural code:  from motor units to muscle contraction**


### A quick look into how to extract MUs in the first place

There are many algorithms currently used to extract MU activity (firing patterns) from EMG recordings: CKC, ICA, as well as other deep learning methods (RNN). The problem with the latter approaches is that we cannot identify new numbers of MUs?

- ICA vs. PCA: 
    - PCA optimizes "the covariance matrix of the data which represents second-order statistics, while ICA optimizes higher-order statistics such as kurtosis". PCA finds uncorrelated components, ICA finds independent componenet.
    - ICA has many algorithms: e.g. FastICA, Infomax. They follow different approches such as:
         1. maximize the non-Gaussianity
         2. minimize the mutual information, or
         3. use maximum likelihood method.

### Decomposed dataset

- The EMG dataset I am using is [publicly available](https://www.physionet.org/content/hd-semg/1.0.0/ndof_dataset/subject02_session2/) described in [Jian et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34018935/)

- I decomposed the 1DoF dataset: retrieved the MUs spike trains. Below is an example of
