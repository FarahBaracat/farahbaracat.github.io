## Some Readings
- Loihi is a fully digital neuromorphic chip with on-chip learning:
  - According to their paper, on Loihi we can have "Widrow-Hoff and its generalization to exploit precise spike 
    timing information" [ReSuMe]
  - Event-driven backpropagation
  - unsupervised sparse dictionary learning using feedback
- Sparse coding is a representation learning method which aims at finding a sparse representation of the input data 
  (also 
  known as sparse coding) in the form of a linear combination of basic elements as well as those basic elements themselves"
- Loihi uses CUBA leaky integrate-and-fire model (which I have never heard of before)
- 

## Coding
- Continued working on the jupyter notebook scratch_data_visualization.ipynb showing the MUs and angles
- Attended talk by Jose Principe on Kernel adaptive models and information theoretic learning
- Refactor notebook into scripts and organize git repo
