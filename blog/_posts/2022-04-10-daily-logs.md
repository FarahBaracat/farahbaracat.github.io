## Aim
To better understand the characteristics of sEMG signals and their relation to the recorded kinematics (eg. joint 
angles, fingers position, speed,...etc. ). For this, the plan is to use the publicly available datasets from [NinaPro 
Database](http://ninaweb.hevs.ch).

## Day 1: April 10, 2022 
### Today's Progress:
- Setup this blog series
- Read about the dataset I will use and muscle synergies
