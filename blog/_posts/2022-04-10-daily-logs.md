title: Daily Logs - Starting a new sEMG Project using NinaProDB
tags: [sEMG Project]

## Aim
To better understand the characteristics of sEMG signals and their relation to the recorded kinematics (eg. joint 
angles, fingers position, speed,...etc. ). For this, the plan is to use the publicly available datasets from [NinaPro 
Database](http://ninaweb.hevs.ch).

## Day 1: April 10, 2022 
### Today's Progress
- Setup this blog series
- Read about the dataset I will use and muscle synergies


### Thoughts
Extremely excited to start this project yet very tired already. Woke up at 3.30 am and its almost 8 am now...will 
probably go back to sleep now :D
