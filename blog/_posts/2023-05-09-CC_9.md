## Morning Session: Exploration vs Exploitation

- Zibra fish:
    - Different populations of neurons coding for different states
    - They keep on oscillating between the states: in one instance: they look for food (they stay locally), in another instance they move around (exploratory behavior)
    - By looking at the neural activity (Ca2+ imaging), we can decode which state they are currently in but also predict for how long they would stay in this state: we can see a decay in those state-populations
- "Constraints make things interesting"


- Strategies for exploration:
    - Aside from external reward, in cases where those are sparse, the agent can have internal rewards (rewarding itself, intermediate ones)
    - RL: peter Dyan:
        - Take reward function and replace it with add additional term (bonus: novelty)
