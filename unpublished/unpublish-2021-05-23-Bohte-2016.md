[comment]: <> (## Motivation)

[comment]: <> (We know that real neurons are very efficient units; they encode input signal and communicate information to downstream neurons with only few spikes. However, it remains unclear how they manage to do that exactly.)

[comment]: <> (The question is can we learn from biology to create similarly highly efficient networks doing computation?)

[comment]: <> (The currently )

[comment]: <> (**Why should we care?**)

[comment]: <> (Sparsity of spikes in a network is a particularly appealing feature for always-on applications, ones running on low-power budget.)

[comment]: <> (To explain how neurons encode a signal with few spikes &#40;efficiently&#41;. A recent line of works suggest that neurons implement a form of  online AD/DA conversion &#40;as as Yoonâ€™s paper&#41; )
