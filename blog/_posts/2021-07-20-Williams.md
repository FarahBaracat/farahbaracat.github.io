### Why am I reading this review paper?
I was looking into the current state of research on proportional nd simultaneous control for prosthesis (i.e how is it achieved? how many DoFs? what about the system stability?)

---
### Motivation
Two main problems with current commercial prosthetic hand controllers:
1. Limited DoFs (typically 1-2 DoF and 10-35% abandonment rate for commercial devices)
    - Notes: There are also the **advanced prosthetic** systems: 10-DoF DEKA/LIKE Arm, 16-DoF Modular Prosthetic Limb "place even higher demands on prosthetic hand controllers".
2. Need recalibration which is requires both time and energy from the user.
3. Feedforward controller require large amount of data to setup the controller. Large data means long recording sessions which is a burden on the user.


---
### Main Contribution
This paper proposes a feed-forward controller that combines linear interpolation, muscle synergy framework and chronically implanted EMG electrodes to achieve a stable, **intuitive**, **continuous**, **proportional** high-DoF control (for 4+ DoF). The main goal here is to **reduce the control training time**.


**Important Distinctions**
 - Intuitive: tailored to the user based on dataset recorded from this user
 - Continuous: regression-based, not limited to fixed discrete states
 - Simultaneous: allowing combinations of movements
 - Proportional: variable

### Methods
- Experiments carried on 2 trans-radial amputees
- Using chronically implanted Electromyographic electrodes (ciEMG). Why? because they were shown to improve feed-forward EMG controllers and hence provide more functional benefits to the user

#### Feed-forward EMF controllers
A typical pipeline for feed-forward controllers involve:
1. Recording & Processing: filtering, windowing into 100-200ms, feature extraction (ex. MAV)
2. Features are mapped to hand velocities.

#### Synergy theory
- Muscles are activated in synergies (which are coordinated activations of groups of muscles dictated by a common neural signal).
- Study assumptions about synergy: 1) time-invariant synergies 2) EMG signals at steady state 3) Only meaningful feature is mean-absolute-value (mABS)
- With these assumptions: EMG signal is the linear combination of EMG from underlying sub-movements.
  
- How does Synergy help reduce the needed data?
   - Users have control over the synergy magnitudes which in turn are linearly proportional to force. This implies that there is no need to record movements at different effort levels (if we have a controller that can do such linear mapping). This is especially true if the mapping between the EMG feature to synergy space is an "orthogonal" change of basis (basically 1-1 projection)

#### Linear interpolation vs linear regression controller
- Here they use linear interpolation to map EMG feature (mABS) to movement intent with the goal of using the trained movements to predict EMG of un-trained movements (through interpolation, the relative relation of this new movement to the known ones is determined)

- Linear interpolation is piece-wise linear (only linear within the partition/region). We can think of it as a middle ground between linear and non-linear regression approaches.
  
- **Input-space** (steady-state EMG features in this case) is partitioned into regions bounded by the recorded inputs

- **Output** is the linear interpolation of these partitions (the goal is to fit the user-data (input-output pairs))
    
- Given a new input EMG signal, $p$: it is first scaled, $p$ is assigned to a partition. Then using linear interpolation, a movement is determined as linear combination of the DoFs, $c_p$ (i.e that would be the user effort in each DoF). Once this is determined, the hand velocity can be found through effort to hand velocity mapping (relation obtained in a "physiological-inspired" way)

### Results
The controller was evaluated on target matching tasks (3 DoFs and 4 DoFs movements). Percentage target match, time-to-target and path efficiency were measured. Controller stability evaluated over 8-10 months period.
1. Linear interpolation controller can provide 4 DoF simultaneous, continuous, proportional control. It is a piece-wise linear
2. The current model relies more on accurate trials rather than large datasets. It can be trained in as little as 3 min.


---
### Limitations 
1. Computational resources: time to sequentially search through the simplices (is not scalable with number of EMG channels and 4+ DoFs)
2. Generalization: Very specific to the recording modality (implanted EMG): "rest" class is not incorporated per se, it occurs when all the EMG signals are close to 0. This assumption won't hold for sEMG as we can have non-zero signals even at rest.

---
### Final Thoughts
- For some reason this reminds me of KNN. This idea of linear interpolation relies on clustering all repetitions of the same movement then given a new input tries to associate it to a cluster (more or less).
- Maybe the distinction here is that it associate the new signal to a linear combination of the known signals rather than a single best cluster?
- The idea of predicting the movement by assigning the EMG signal to one of the partition, I think, is relying on this Synergy theory they claim. The reason is that it assumes that EMG signal of this new movement is the combinations of simpler movements (the ones they trained on).
