## Quick recap for the past days:
- I gave my first in-person presentation on Tuesday this week (28.06.2022) on neuromorphic computing and prosthesis. 
  It went well but I was very stressed about it. Got really nice questions and feedback on the presentation 
  afterwards.
- So I have been working on the presentation on Friday-Monday with only a bit of time to look into a sample of the 
  [Hyser](https://www.physionet.org/content/hd-semg/1.0.0/ndof_dataset/subject02_session2/) dataset and the MATLAB code that comes with it (for loading and computing the MU using fast ICA)


## Simone Kinematics dataset
- How to access files in the shared OneDrive without downloading everything? 
  - I don't think that is possible (will look into it later then)
- Will focus instead of opening an angle file, understand the computed joint angles and try to plot that against the 
  EMG and MUs
  - Questions for Simone:
    1. Which rep was removed? is it the first or the last? In the angles plot it starts from 0
    2. What is the unit of the angle?
