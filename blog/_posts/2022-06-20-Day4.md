## Kickoff Meeting Minutes
**June 20**: Had a first meeting with Dario and Deren

- They have a dataset with force measurements using load cells on single finger while the participants fixed their hand
- Regarding the problem of number of MUs, they had an idea involving using the cumulative spike trains instead of 
  single MUs but this means that the input firing rate is high (since it is the superimposed activity of multiple MUs)
- They mentioned some work on synergies: moving from high dimensional space to a lower dimensional space (grouping 
  MUs together)?
- Regarding speed, Dario said that speed is what happens during the movements, once we have contact with an object 
  this then becomes force?
- Deren mentioned something interesting, the users of the system can also be stroke patients, spinal cord injuries 
  and not only amputees.

### Action Plan
- Meet with Patrick and discuss with him the available prostheses to use and what he thinks about the number of DoFs.
- In couple of days, meet again with Dario and Deren to define a more concrete plan and timeline for the project.
